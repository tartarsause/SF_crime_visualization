# SF_crime_visualization
Analysis of crime in San Francisco using crime data from 2003-2015 obtained from Kaggle and generation of visualizations using R.

In order to run the sfCrime_visualization.R script, be sure to have RStudio installed along with all necessary libraries first. The required libraries can be found at the beginning of the R script.

Next, search through the script for the 2 TODO parts, the first should be to properly define the working directory of the crime dataset. The second should be to enter a valid Google Cloud Platform API key in order to produce map backgrounds.

Once both TODOs have been completed, run the entire script with ctrl+alt+R or run each individual line with ctrl+enter.

If the entire script has been run, give it a few moments to produce the images and there should be 9 png images in the working directory.
